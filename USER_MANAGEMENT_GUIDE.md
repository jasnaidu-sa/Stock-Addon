# User Management System - Admin Controlled

## Overview
This system has been configured for **admin-controlled user management** where:
- âœ… **No email verification required** - Users can log in immediately
- âœ… **Admin creates all accounts** - No self-registration
- âœ… **Instant access** - Users receive credentials and can log in right away
- âœ… **Full admin control** - Create, edit, delete, and manage all users

## How It Works

### 1. User Creation Process
When an admin creates a new user:
1. User is created in Supabase Auth with `emailRedirectTo: undefined` (skips email confirmation)
2. User record is inserted into the database with `status: 'active'`
3. `email_confirmed_at` is set to current timestamp (marks email as confirmed)
4. User can **log in immediately** with provided credentials

### 2. Admin Capabilities
Admins can:
- âœ… **Create Users** - With email, password, name, role, group, company
- âœ… **Edit Users** - Update any user information and roles
- âœ… **Delete Users** - Remove users from both database and auth system
- âœ… **Reset Passwords** - Send password reset emails when needed
- âœ… **Manage Roles** - Switch between Admin/User roles
- âœ… **Control Status** - Enable/disable user accounts

### 3. User Experience
For end users:
- ðŸš€ **Immediate Access** - No waiting for email confirmation
- ðŸ”‘ **Direct Login** - Use credentials provided by admin
- ðŸ“§ **Password Reset** - Can request password reset if needed
- ðŸ‘¤ **Role-based Access** - Different permissions based on assigned role

## Admin Panel Access

### Navigate to User Management:
1. Log in as an admin
2. Go to `/admin` 
3. Click on "Users" tab or "User Management"
4. Use the interface to manage all users

### Creating Your First Admin User:
Run the admin creation script:
```bash
cd project
node create-cventer-admin-final.js
```

Or use the web tool at: `project/public/create-admin-user.html`

- Users get immediate access
- Streamlined onboarding process

### âœ… **Control**
- Admin decides who gets access
- Full oversight of all users

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
Users table includes:
- `id` - Matches Supabase Auth user ID
- `email` - User's email address
- `name` - Full name
- `role` - 'admin' or 'user'
- `group_type` - 'Franchisee' or 'Regional'
- `company_name` - Company/organization
- `status` - 'active', 'disabled', or 'pending'
- `email_confirmed_at` - Set immediately upon creation
- `created_at` - Account creation timestamp
- `last_sign_in_at` - Last login time

### Auth Configuration
- Email confirmation disabled via `emailRedirectTo: undefined`
- Users marked as confirmed immediately
- Password-based authentication enabled
- Session persistence configured

## Troubleshooting

### If Users Can't Log In:
1. Check user status is 'active' in admin panel
2. Verify email and password are correct
3. Ensure user exists in both auth and database
4. Check for any error messages in browser console

### If Admin Creation Fails:
1. Try the web-based creation tool
2. Check Supabase connection
3. Verify environment variables are set
4. Check browser console for errors

## Migration Notes

This system has been updated from email-verification based to admin-controlled:
- Existing users remain unaffected
- New users created without email verification
- All user management now centralized in admin panel
- Email verification dependencies removed
