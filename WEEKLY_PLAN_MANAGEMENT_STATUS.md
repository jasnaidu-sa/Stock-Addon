# Weekly Plan Management System - Implementation Status

## Overview
Implementation of multi-level weekly plan management system with Area Manager and Regional Manager interfaces for The Bed Shop Stock Addon.

## Completed Features

### ‚úÖ Area Manager Interface
**Location**: `src/components/area-manager/area-manager-interface.tsx`

**Features Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ Real Clerk authentication integration with Supabase user lookup
- ‚úÖ Multi-store management via `regional_manager_store_allocations` table
- ‚úÖ Amendment creation, editing, and submission capabilities
- ‚úÖ Store filtering dropdown (all stores vs individual store)
- ‚úÖ Summary cards: Total overview + Store breakdown with scrolling
- ‚úÖ Submit button in navigation bar with pending count
- ‚úÖ Category tabs with quantity badges and multi-row layout
- ‚úÖ Inline amendment editing with yellow highlighting
- ‚úÖ Comment system for adding to existing amendments
- ‚úÖ Review and approval workflow for submitted amendments

**Database Integration:**
- Uses `regional_manager_store_allocations` for store access
- Amendment operations on `weekly_plan_amendments` table
- Proper column names (`amended_qty`, not `amendment_qty`)
- Correct role constraints (`regional_manager` for `created_by_role`)
- Fixed URL length limit issue in submit functionality

### ‚úÖ Regional Manager Interface  
**Location**: `src/components/regional-manager/regional-manager-interface.tsx`

**Features Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ Identical functionality to Area Manager Interface
- ‚úÖ Uses `regional_manager_store_allocations` table for store access
- ‚úÖ Header: "Regional Manager Dashboard" with "Regional Weekly Plan Management"
- ‚úÖ All amendment, filtering, and submission capabilities
- ‚úÖ Same store breakdown card design with enhanced scrolling

**Routing Fixed:**
- ‚úÖ Updated `src/pages/regional-manager/dashboard.tsx` to use new interface
- ‚úÖ Removed "under development" placeholder message

### ‚úÖ Store Breakdown Card Enhancements
**Applied to Both Interfaces:**
- ‚úÖ Fixed height container (`h-80` = 320px) for proper scrolling
- ‚úÖ Sticky column headers with proper z-index
- ‚úÖ Compact spacing (`space-y-0.5`, `py-0.5`) to show more stores
- ‚úÖ Proper padding structure with `CardContent p-0`
- ‚úÖ Enhanced column spacing (gap-6, w-12) for better readability

## Current Issues & Debugging

### üîç Store Breakdown Data Mismatch
**Problem**: Regional manager with 23 stores only shows 2 in breakdown card, and some stores show zero quantities when they should have data (e.g., Thavhani shows items in header stats but zero in breakdown table).

**Debugging Added:**
- ‚úÖ Enhanced store loading debug with ID vs name matching
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive breakdown calculation logging  
- ‚úÖ Special tracking for specific stores (Thavhani)
- ‚úÖ Fallback logic to show all stores even without weekly plan data
- ‚úÖ Console logging for data flow analysis

**Debug Console Output to Check:**
```
Store Thavhani: {store_id: 'xxx', itemsById: X, itemsByName: Y, totalQtyById: Z, totalQtyByName: W}
THAVHANI ITEM X: {stock_code: 'XXX', act_order_qty: X, store_id: 'xxx', store_name: 'Thavhani'}
THAVHANI RUNNING TOTAL: {storeName: 'Thavhani', totalQtyOrdered: X, ...}
```

**Potential Root Causes:**
1. Store ID mismatch between allocation and weekly plan tables
2. Store name inconsistencies between data sources
3. Store filter affecting data visibility
4. Category/subcategory structure issues
5. Weekly plan data missing for some stores

## Technical Architecture

### Database Tables Used:
- **`regional_manager_store_allocations`**: Links regional managers to stores
- **`weekly_plan`**: Contains weekly plan items with quantities
- **`weekly_plan_amendments`**: Stores amendment requests and approvals
- **`users`**: Authentication and role management
- **`stores`**: Store master data

### Authentication Flow:
1. Clerk provides `userId`
2. Lookup Supabase user via `clerk_id` field
3. Get store allocations via `regional_manager_store_allocations`
4. Load weekly plan data for allocated stores
5. Load amendments for allocated stores

### Amendment Workflow:
1. **Create**: Area/Regional manager creates amendment with justification
2. **Edit**: Can modify quantity and add further comments
3. **Submit**: Batch submit all pending amendments
4. **Review**: Approve/reject with admin notes
5. **Status**: pending ‚Üí submitted ‚Üí approved/rejected

## Files Modified

### Core Components:
- `src/components/area-manager/area-manager-interface.tsx` - Main Area Manager interface
- `src/components/regional-manager/regional-manager-interface.tsx` - Main Regional Manager interface  
- `src/pages/regional-manager/dashboard.tsx` - Regional Manager routing

### Database Scripts Created (for debugging):
- `check-amendment-schema.js` - Database structure verification
- `check-amendment-structure.js` - Data structure analysis
- `check-role-constraints.js` - Role constraint testing

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority:
1. **Fix Store Breakdown Data Issue**: Resolve the mismatch between store loading and breakdown calculation
2. **Remove Debug Logging**: Clean up console logs once data issue is resolved
3. **Test with All User Roles**: Verify functionality works for different regional managers

### Future Enhancements:
1. **Performance Optimization**: Add data caching for large store lists
2. **Bulk Operations**: Mass amendment approval/rejection
3. **Reporting**: Export capabilities for amendment history
4. **Notifications**: Alert system for pending amendments

## Testing Credentials

**Regional Manager Test User:**
- Access via Clerk authentication
- Should have stores allocated via `regional_manager_store_allocations`
- Expected: 23 stores in breakdown card with proper scrolling

## Notes

- Both interfaces use identical code structure for consistency
- Database queries optimized to prevent URL length limits
- Amendment system supports hierarchical comments (store manager ‚Üí area manager ‚Üí regional manager)
- All authentication properly integrated with Clerk + Supabase RLS policies
