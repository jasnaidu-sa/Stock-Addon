# Weekly Plans Amendment Workflow - Discussion Document

## Project Context
**Date:** 2025-07-09
**Project:** The Bed Shop Stock Addon - Weekly Plans Amendment System
**Status:** Design Phase - Discussion Document

## Background
We had a long discussion on setting up a new process for weekly plans amendments. The current system only allows admin users to upload and manage weekly plans. We need to create a workflow where store users can make amendments to their assigned stores' weekly plans, which then go through an approval process.

## Current System Analysis

### ‚úÖ What we have:
- Weekly plan Excel upload system in `/src/pages/admin/weekly-plan.tsx`
- Basic weekly plan storage with all necessary fields in `weekly_plan` table
- Admin-only upload and management via `WeeklyPlanUpload` component
- Store name, category, stock codes, quantities tracking
- User roles: 'admin' and 'customer' in users table
- Comprehensive mattress/base cart rules system

### üîç Key Data Fields Available in `weekly_plan` table:
- `store_name` - Critical for store-based access
- `category` - For tab navigation (mattress, furniture, accessories, foam)
- `stock_code`, `description` - For SKU identification
- `order_qty`, `act_order_qty` - Base quantities
- `add_ons_qty` - For amendments/add-ons
- `reference` - Week reference (e.g., "Week 28")
- `start_date` - Week start date
- Various quantity fields: `qty_on_hand`, `qty_in_transit`, `qty_pending_orders`

### üîß Existing Mattress/Base Rules (From Cart System):
Located in multiple files under `/src/components/cart/` and `/src/lib/product-utils.ts`:

1. **Quantity Synchronization**: When mattress quantities change, corresponding base quantities automatically update based on `base_qty` multiplier
2. **Base Inclusion Option**: Users can choose whether to include bases with mattresses
3. **Synthetic ID System**: Bases added with mattresses get synthetic IDs (`${mattressId}_base`)
4. **Code Relationships**: Mattresses have `mattress_code` and `base_code` properties to link to corresponding bases
5. **Product Type Differentiation**: Cart items distinguish between 'mattress' and 'base' product types
6. **Price Calculation**: Different pricing logic for mattresses with/without bases (set_price vs mattress_price)
7. **Database Lookup**: Bases are looked up dynamically using the mattress's `base_code` property

## Proposed New Workflow - UPDATED REQUIREMENTS

### Phase 1: Regional Manager & Store Allocation System

**New User Role:**
- **Regional Manager** - New role between admin and customer
- Regional Managers login and see only their allocated stores
- Only **Admin** approves all amendments (single approval level)

**New Database Tables Needed:**

1. **`stores`** - Master store list (Excel uploadable)
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE stores (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
     store_code VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
     store_name VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
     region VARCHAR(100),
     address TEXT,
     contact_person VARCHAR(100),
     phone VARCHAR(50),
     email VARCHAR(100),
     active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
     created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
     updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   ```

2. **`categories`** - Product categories (Excel uploadable)
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE categories (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
     category_code VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
     category_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
     description TEXT,
     sort_order INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
     active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
     created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   ```

3. **`regional_manager_store_allocations`** - Link regional managers to specific stores
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE regional_manager_store_allocations (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
     user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
     store_id UUID REFERENCES stores(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
     allocated_by UUID REFERENCES users(id), -- Admin who made allocation
     allocated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
     active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
     UNIQUE(user_id, store_id)
   );
   ```

4. **`weekly_plan_amendments`** - Track regional manager changes and admin approvals
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE weekly_plan_amendments (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
     weekly_plan_id UUID REFERENCES weekly_plan(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
     user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE, -- Regional Manager making change
     store_id UUID REFERENCES stores(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
     week_reference VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- e.g., "Week 28"
     week_start_date DATE NOT NULL,
     amendment_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'add_on', 'quantity_change', 'new_item', 'admin_edit'
     original_qty INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
     amended_qty INTEGER NOT NULL,
     justification TEXT,
     status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'submitted', 'admin_review', 'approved', 'rejected')),
     admin_id UUID REFERENCES users(id), -- Admin who approves/rejects
     admin_notes TEXT,
     created_by_role VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- 'regional_manager', 'admin'
     created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
     updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   ```

5. **`week_selections`** - Available weeks for amendment selection
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE week_selections (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
     week_reference VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL, -- e.g., "Week 28"
     week_start_date DATE NOT NULL,
     week_end_date DATE NOT NULL,
     year INTEGER NOT NULL,
     week_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
     is_current BOOLEAN DEFAULT false, -- Only one current week
     is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true, -- Available for amendments
     created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   ```

### Phase 2: Excel Upload Processes

**New Excel Upload Capabilities:**

1. **Store Master Upload** (`/admin/stores-upload`)
   - Excel format: Store Code, Store Name, Region, Address, Contact Person, Phone, Email
   - Validation: Unique store codes, required fields
   - Bulk insert/update existing stores

2. **Category Master Upload** (`/admin/categories-upload`)
   - Excel format: Category Code, Category Name, Description, Sort Order
   - Validation: Unique category codes, numeric sort order
   - Integration with existing weekly plan categories

3. **Regional Manager Store Allocations Upload** (`/admin/allocations-upload`)
   - Excel format: Regional Manager Email, Store Code(s)
   - Validation: Valid user emails, existing store codes
   - Bulk allocation assignment

### Phase 3: User Interface Flow

**Regional Manager Experience:**
1. **Week Selection** - Choose current/available week for amendments
2. **Store Selection View** - See only allocated stores from their assignments
3. **Category Tabs** - Navigation by uploaded categories (mattress, furniture, accessories, foam)
4. **SKU Management** - Grid view with:
   - Original planned quantities for selected week
   - Amendment fields for add-ons
   - **Mattress/Base Rules Applied** - When mattress quantities change, base quantities auto-adjust
5. **Submit for Approval** - Changes go to admin with status tracking

**Admin Experience:**
1. **Week Management** - Set current week, activate/deactivate weeks for amendments
2. **Store & Category Management** - Excel uploads for master data
3. **Regional Manager Allocation** - Assign stores to regional managers
4. **Amendment Dashboard** - View all pending amendments by store/regional manager
5. **Amendment Approval Interface** - Accept/reject/modify individual amendments (single approval level)
6. **Amendment Management Only** - Admins work ONLY with amendment records:
   - Review regional manager amendment requests
   - Approve/reject/modify amendment quantities  
   - NO direct editing of base weekly plan data
   - Original weekly plan data remains unchanged by admin
   - Approved amendments update `weekly_plan.add_ons_qty` field only
7. **Excel Export Capabilities**:
   - Download final amended weekly plans (original + approved amendments)
   - Export amendment summary reports by store/week
   - Export pending amendments for review
   - Export amendment audit trail

### Phase 4: Mattress/Base Rules Integration

**Key Rules to Apply from Existing Cart System:**
- When regional manager increases mattress quantities, system auto-calculates base requirements
- Base quantities sync with mattress changes using `base_qty` multiplier
- Price calculations for mattresses with/without bases
- Validation for mattress-base combinations
- Use existing utilities from `/src/lib/product-utils.ts`:
  - `fetchBaseInfoByCode()` function
  - Base product lookup logic
  - Product type differentiation

## üîÑ UPDATED MULTI-LEVEL HIERARCHY REQUIREMENTS (2025-07-15)

### CORRECTED 4-Level Hierarchy Structure with Proper Relationships:
1. **Store Manager** - Individual store credentials (lowest level)
2. **Area Manager** - Manages subset of stores (**1:many AM‚ÜíStores**)
3. **Regional Manager** - Manages area managers (**1:many RM‚ÜíAM**)
4. **Admin** - Top level with full access

### Relationship Model:
- **Regional Manager** ‚Üí **Area Managers** (1:many)
- **Area Manager** ‚Üí **Stores** (1:many)  
- **Store Manager** ‚Üí **Store** (1:1)

### Key Design Decisions:

#### A. Amendment Approval Workflow - HYBRID APPROACH:
- **Store Manager amendments** ‚Üí Require Area Manager approval
- **Area Manager direct amendments** ‚Üí Go straight to final plan (no approval needed)
- **Regional Manager direct amendments** ‚Üí Go straight to final plan (no approval needed)
- **Admin amendments** ‚Üí Direct edit capability (immediate save)

#### B. Deadline Management - DASHBOARD DRIVEN:
- **No strict system deadlines**
- **Manual process management** through dashboards
- Each level has visibility dashboards showing:
  - Who has submitted
  - Who has pending work
  - Amendment status tracking

#### C. Data Visibility - FULL ACCESS WITH SUMMARIES:
- **All levels see all store data**
- **Role-appropriate summaries and dashboards**:
  - Store Manager: Own store focus
  - Area Manager: Area summary + store details
  - Regional Manager: Regional summary + area breakdowns
  - Admin: Full organizational view

#### D. Upload Structure - SEPARATE MANAGEMENT LEVELS:
- **Store Master Upload**: Code, Name, Region, Store Size (optional), Email (optional)
- **Area Manager Assignment Upload**: Area managers assigned to stores
- **Regional Manager Assignment Upload**: Regional managers assigned to area managers
- **Direct Regional-Store Assignment**: When no area manager exists
- **Validation Dashboards**:
  - Unassigned stores (no area manager)
  - Unassigned area managers (no regional manager)

#### E. Enhanced User Creation Process:
- **Auto-user creation from Excel uploads**
- **Required fields**: First Name, Last Name, Email
- **Optional fields**: Contact Number
- **Password Pattern**: `[LastName]2024!` (e.g., Smith2024!, Johnson2024!)
- **Follows existing manual user setup process** in `/src/lib/clerk-admin.ts`

#### F. Additional Requirements:
- **Mandatory Store Submission**: Store managers MUST submit even with no amendments
- **Visibility of Submissions**: Area/Regional managers see submission status
- **Auto-escalation**: Stores without area managers go directly to regional manager
- **Data Caching**: Load all store data on login for performance
- **Comprehensive Validation**: All suggested validation dashboards implemented

### Updated Database Schema Requirements:

1. **Enhanced `users` table** - Add area_manager role:
   ```sql
   -- Modify role check to include:
   role VARCHAR(20) CHECK (role IN ('admin', 'regional_manager', 'area_manager', 'store_manager', 'customer'))
   ```

2. **Enhanced `stores` table** - Add size field:
   ```sql
   store_size VARCHAR(50), -- small, medium, large, etc.
   ```

3. **New `area_manager_store_assignments` table**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE area_manager_store_assignments (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
     area_manager_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
     store_id UUID REFERENCES stores(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
     assigned_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
     assigned_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
     active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
     UNIQUE(area_manager_id, store_id)
   );
   ```

4. **New `regional_area_manager_assignments` table**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE regional_area_manager_assignments (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
     regional_manager_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
     area_manager_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
     assigned_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
     assigned_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
     active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
     UNIQUE(regional_manager_id, area_manager_id)
   );
   ```

5. **Enhanced `weekly_plan_amendments` table** - Track submission status:
   ```sql
   -- Add fields:
   submitted_by_role VARCHAR(20), -- 'store_manager', 'area_manager', etc.
   is_no_change_submission BOOLEAN DEFAULT false, -- For mandatory submissions with no changes
   approved_by_role VARCHAR(20), -- Track who approved (area_manager, regional_manager, admin)
   ```
