# Coding Workflow Perferences

- Focus on areas of code relevant to the task
- Do no touch code that is unrelated to the task
- Wrtie thorough tests for all major functionality
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
