        "headers": [
          {"key": "X-Content-Type-Options", "value": "nosniff"},
          {"key": "X-Frame-Options", "value": "DENY"},
          {"key": "X-XSS-Protection", "value": "1; mode=block"},
          {"key": "Strict-Transport-Security", "value": "max-age=63072000"}
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

#### 2.2 Performance Optimization
- [ ] **Implement code splitting**:
  ```typescript
  const AdminLayout = lazy(() => import('@/components/layout/admin-layout'));
  const CategoryPage = lazy(() => import('@/pages/category/[id]'));
  ```
- [ ] **Optimize Vite configuration** with manual chunks
- [ ] **Add React performance patterns**:
  - React.memo for expensive components
  - useMemo for calculations
  - useCallback for event handlers
- [ ] **Implement bundle analyzer** to monitor size

### **WEEK 4 DELIVERABLES**

#### 2.3 Data Fetching Optimization
